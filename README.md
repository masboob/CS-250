How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Interpreting user needs usually start with the analysis of the system. This can be done by asking the team for feedback, asking previous users for any errors or changes they should see within the code. Inputs and outputs should be identified as well. User stories can help with gathering information because this is where the users can express their needs and wants. Looking at the user stories help us understand the end users perspective. 



How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- You can approach developing programs in a couple different ways.  Waterfall Method is one strategy.  Waterfall helps in projecting the needs of a specific strategy. 
Another method is Agile; agile seems to offer a more flexible strategy and it is a more unique way to work with testing, planning and client integration
